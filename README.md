# **MINI-PROJECT 1**

</br>

# Steps

1. Clone this repo to your computer (git clone "ssh code without quotes")
2. cd into the directory

3. Do some research, have a look at the free APIs and come up with an idea for a project that will test your knowledge from modules 1 - 4
4. List the requirements below
5. Do some low-fi drawings 
6. Do a flow chart & hi-fi drawings on Figma
7. Create your application with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Fetch / Axios and Bootstrap
8. Fill in the questions below
9. Push your code to github

10. Present your project to the class (Aim for 5 min presentation. Use points below as talking points)

## ▪ What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?

```
The requirements for this project:
- An API with information about dogs including breeding group, lifespan and images of the dogs
- VS code - use HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap 
- buttons for users to filter through the different dog breeds 
- a search container where users can type in the name of a dog they are looking for 
The first step was to choose an API, fetch the data and test to see if the API was working. Once the data was successfully retrieved, the next step was to examine the data and decide on an application to build including designing the application using lo-fi and high fi sketches to make the designs come to life. 
```
</br>

## ▪ Give a high level overview of your application and its features.

```
The Dog Breed Library allows users to browse/search and filter through different dog breed cards to obtain information about the specific dog breed they are looking for. Each card includes the name of the dog, a picture, the dog breed and other useful information such as the temperament of the dog and lifespan. The page allows the user to click on the 'Graphs' button and takes the user to a webpage showing 2x charts 
```

</br>

## ▪ Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?

```
The data comes from an external API 'https://api.thedogapi.com/v1/breeds'. This API was free and public which allowed me to retrieve this data and display it to the user.
```
</br>

## ▪ How does the back end process this data?

```
The backend processes the API data for dog breeds by receiving the data from the API endpoint
(The API endpoint is a specific URL that an API (Application Programming Interface) uses to access a particular set of data or perform a specific action. It is a server-side URL that receives requests from client-side applications, such as web or mobile applications, and returns responses containing the requested data or actions). The backend performs operations on the data (once it has been received from the API endpoint) by storing it in a database, analysing it and transforming it into a different format after the data has been processed. The backend then sends a response back to the client.  
```
</br>

## ▪ How can the user interact with this data?
```
The user can interact with this API data in two ways, mainly web applications and mobile applications. Both the web and mobile applications use the API to access this data/information about dogs from the server and display this information in a user-friendly way to users.
```
</br>

## ▪ What JS techniques have you used ?
*(eg. objects/arrays/DOMfunctions/loops/functions/ifs)*
```
1. 'fetch()' - a method that fetches the resource from a server (ie. API data for dogs) and loads the information 
that is returned by the server on the webpages. (It returns a promise that resolves to a response).
2. arrays 
3. Promises ('response')
4. Arrow functions
5. 'querySelector()' and 'querySelectorAll()' - allos the selection of HTML elements in the DOM
6. Template literals - aka template strings, type of string literal in JS that allow you to embed expressions inside a string. Template literals are defined using backticks instead of quotes
7. 'replaceChildren()' - a method that replaces the children of a DOM element with new nodes
8. 'appendChild()' - allows you to add a child element to an existing parent element in a webpage. It is a DOM method used to manipulate the HTML structure of a web page dynamically
9. 'addEventListener()' -addEventListener() is a method in JavaScript that allows you to attach an event handler function to an element on a web page. An event is a user or browser action that triggers a specific functionality, like a mouse click or keyboard press.The addEventListener() method takes two arguments: the type of event to listen for, and the function that will be called when the event occurs. The function that is passed as the second argument is known as the event handler function.
10. 'toUpperCase()'- a method that converts a string to uppercase
11. 'indexOf()'-a built-in method in JavaScript that is used to search for a specific value in an array or a string. It returns the index of the first occurrence of the value in the array or string, or -1 if the value is not found.
12. 'innerHtml' - A property that sets or returns the HTML content of an element
13. 'forEach'-
14 'for', 'if', 'else' 

</br>
```
## ▪ What external tools/libraries have you used? How? Why?
*(eg. bootstrap/axios/charts)*
```
external Boostrap CSS and JS libraries - to make things responsive. Bootstrap's CSS can adjust to phones, desktops
and tablets. This was done by putting the links within the <head> tags.
</br>
```
## ▪ What kinds of HTML elements have you used
```
(eg. tables, forms, divs, lists, headings, menus, videos, images)?
1.divs
2.template tag
3.header tag
4.id
5.images

</br>
```
## ▪ What kinds of CSS features have you used ?
*(eg. animations, backgrounds, fonts, colours, flexbox, grid)*
```
font styling (ie. font-weight and font-size), overflow - to hide overflow, flexbox, colours - background color and colour of fonts. 

</br>
```
## ▪ How might you extend the features of your application in future?

```
Some ways that 'the Dog Breed Library' can be extended in future are:
1. E-commerce: allowing users to buy and sell dog products 
2. Health and wellness of dogs: The platform could introduce tools that allow owners to monitor the health and wellness of their dogs by partnering with veterinary providers that offer telemedicine
3. Events: The platform could have a list of events where dog owners can get together and socialise with each other
4. Forum: The platform could introduce a forum where dog owners can connect with each other in the community and around the world, share information and resources,seek advice and ask questions.
